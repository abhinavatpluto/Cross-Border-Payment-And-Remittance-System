# Cross-Border-Payment-And-Remittance-System


# Cross‑Border Payment & Remittance Platform — README

> **Note:** This README intentionally omits any company name. It describes a microservices-based cross-border payment system implemented in Java (Java 8 baseline) with PostgreSQL, Spring Boot and other modern technologies. Each microservice follows the **MVC** pattern internally.

---

## Project Summary

This project is a **scalable, resilient, and secure cross-border remittance and payment processing platform**. It supports multiple modules such as validation, bank credit, exchange-rate handling, KYC, forex-provider plugins, compliance and notifications. The platform is designed for high throughput across multiple financial corridors while satisfying regulatory and audit requirements.

Key goals:

* Reliable money transfer across borders
* Compliance with regulatory and KYC requirements
* Low latency and high throughput
* Observability, security, and fault-tolerance

# Architecture Overview

**High level:**

Client (web / mobile) → **API Gateway** → Auth (OAuth2 / Keycloak) → Microservices → Datastores & Message Bus

Each microservice is independent, follows the internal **MVC pattern** (Controller, Service, Repository), exposes RESTful APIs and communicates via **synchronous REST** when necessary and **asynchronous events** (Kafka) for cross-service workflows.

Main components:

* **API Gateway** (single entry-point, routing, rate-limiting, auth)
* **Config Server** (centralized configuration)
* **Service Registry** (optional - Eureka or rely on Kubernetes DNS)
* **Validation Service** (input & business validation)
* **KYC Service** (identity verification, document handling)
* **Exchange Rate Service** (live rates & caching)
* **Forex Plugin Service** (adapters to external forex providers)
* **Transaction / Bank Credit Service** (core transfers & ledger entries)
* **Compliance & Audit Service** (rules & immutable audit trails)
* **Notification Service** (email / SMS / push)
* **Shared Libraries** (common DTOs, exceptions, security helpers)

Cross‑service communication patterns:

* **Event‑driven choreography** for most flows (Kafka topics)
* **Saga pattern** (orchestrator or choreography) for distributed transactions
* **CQRS** where read performance is critical (read replicas/denormalized read models)

# How Each Microservice Follows MVC

Within each microservice:

* **Controller (MVC - C)**

  * REST controllers (`@RestController`) exposing endpoints.
  * Responsible for request validation (DTOs, `@Valid`), mapping to service layer.

* **Service (MVC - V + business logic)**

  * Business logic as `@Service` classes.
  * Orchestrates calls to repositories, other services, and publishes domain events.

* **Repository (MVC - M)**

  * Spring Data JPA repositories mapping Entities to Postgres.

* **DTOs & Mappers**

  * Use DTOs for API boundaries, MapStruct for mapping between Entities & DTOs.

* **Other layers**

  * **Validators**: reusable validation rules.
  * **Exception Handlers**: `@ControllerAdvice` for standardized API errors.
  * **Security Filters**: request auth/authorization.
  * **Event Handlers**: Kafka consumers producing domain events.

Folder structure example (per service):

```
src/main/java
└── com.company.service
    ├── controller
    ├── service
    ├── repository
    ├── model    (entities)
    ├── dto
    ├── mapper
    ├── config
    └── exception
```

# Important Design Patterns to Use

* **API Gateway** (Spring Cloud Gateway) — single client entry, authentication, rate limiting.
* **Saga pattern** — manage distributed transactions across services (orchestrator or choreography).
* **Circuit Breaker & Retry** (Resilience4j) — prevent cascading failures.
* **Event‑Driven Architecture (Kafka)** — decouple services and increase resiliency.
* **CQRS + Read Models** — separate writes and reads where high read performance is required.
* **Event Sourcing** (optional for audit & traceability) — store events as source of truth.
* **Bulkhead** — isolate resource groups to prevent contention.
* **Strangler Fig** — for incremental migration from monoliths.

---

# SOLID & Other Engineering Principles

* **Single Responsibility**: one primary responsibility per service/class.
* **Open/Closed**: easy to add new corridors/providers without changing core flows.
* **Liskov Substitution**: interchangeable provider implementations.
* **Interface Segregation**: small, focused interfaces.
* **Dependency Inversion**: rely on abstractions – `@Autowired` interfaces, not concrete classes.
* **12‑factor app**: config in environment, treat logs as event streams, stateless services.

# Data Model (Suggested Tables)

**Important entities (simplified):**

### transactions

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  external_id VARCHAR(128),
  sender_account_id UUID,
  receiver_account_id UUID,
  amount NUMERIC(18,6),
  currency VARCHAR(3),
  status VARCHAR(32), -- PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

### users / accounts

```sql
CREATE TABLE accounts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  balance NUMERIC(18,6) DEFAULT 0,
  currency VARCHAR(3)
);
```

### exchange\_rates

```sql
CREATE TABLE exchange_rates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  from_currency VARCHAR(3),
  to_currency VARCHAR(3),
  rate NUMERIC(18,8),
  retrieved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

### kyc\_records

```sql
CREATE TABLE kyc_records (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID,
  status VARCHAR(32), -- PENDING, VERIFIED, REJECTED
  details JSONB,
  verified_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### audit\_log

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  entity_id UUID,
  entity_type VARCHAR(64),
  action VARCHAR(64),
  payload JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```

Consider **append‑only** audit tables for compliance.

# API Contracts — Example Endpoints

**Transaction Service**

* `POST /api/v1/transactions` — create transaction request

  * Request body: `{ "senderId": "...", "receiverId": "...", "amount": 100.0, "currency": "USD" }`
  * Response: `{ "transactionId": "...", "status": "PENDING" }`

* `GET /api/v1/transactions/{id}` — fetch transaction status

**Validation Service**

* `POST /api/v1/validate/transaction` — validate business rules

**KYC Service**

* `GET /api/v1/kyc/{userId}` — fetch kyc status

Use **OpenAPI/Swagger** for API documentation and client code generation.

---

# Event Topics (Kafka) — Suggested

* `transactions.created` — posted when a transaction is initiated
* `transactions.validated` — result from validation
* `transactions.executed` — when bank credit is successful
* `transactions.failed`
* `kyc.requested`, `kyc.updated`
* `exchange_rate.updated`

Each event should have a versioned schema and use a schema registry (Avro/Confluent or JSON Schema).

---

# Local Development — Step‑by‑Step (first sprint)

This is a step-by-step checklist to get started:

**Prerequisites:** Java 8 (or 11/17 preferred), Maven/Gradle, Docker, Docker Compose, Git

**1) Create repository skeleton**

* Option A: Mono‑repo with Maven multi‑module

  * parent-pom
  * modules: `common`, `gateway`, `config-server`, `discovery`, `transaction-service`, `validation-service`, `kyc-service`, `exchange-service`, `bank-credit-service`, `notification-service`, `audit-service`
* Option B: Multi‑repo (one repo per service) — more operational overhead initially.

**2) Generate basic Spring Boot projects**

* Use Spring Initializr or IDE to generate service skeletons (Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Validation, Lombok, Actuator).

**3) Implement `common` module**

* DTOs, exceptions, error models, shared mappers, correlation ID util.

**4) Config & Discovery**

* Set up Spring Cloud Config server (pointing to a `config` Git repo or file system)
* Optional: Eureka discovery server if not using Kubernetes.

**5) Local infrastructure (Docker)**

* Start Postgres, Kafka (or use Confluent platform), Redis, Keycloak for auth. Example command for Postgres:

  ```bash
  docker run -d --name pg -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 postgres:13
  ```
* For integration tests, use Testcontainers instead of global docker resources.

**6) Implement Transaction Service (MVP)**

* Follow MVC: `TransactionController`, `TransactionService`, `TransactionRepository`, `TransactionEntity`, `TransactionDto`.
* Add DB migrations (Flyway) to create `transactions` table.
* Publish `transactions.created` event to Kafka on creation.

**7) Implement Validation Service**

* Expose validation API and Kafka consumer to listen to `transactions.created` and publish `transactions.validated`.

**8) Saga/Orchestration**

* Implement a simple orchestration (a Saga coordinator microservice or the Transaction Service itself) to react to validation and call Bank Credit.

**9) Add security**

* Integrate Keycloak / OAuth2 for service endpoints. Secure APIs behind API Gateway.

**10) Add tests & CI**

* Unit tests (JUnit5 + Mockito)
* Integration tests (Testcontainers)
* Add GitHub Actions pipeline to build, test, and publish Docker images.

---

# CI/CD & Deployment

* Build images on merge to `main` using GitHub Actions.
* Push to Docker registry (DockerHub / ECR / GCR).
* Deploy to Kubernetes with Helm; provide separate `values.yaml` for `dev`/`staging`/`prod`.
* Canary deployments / rolling updates for zero-downtime.

---

# Testing Strategy

* **Unit tests:** logic in isolation.
* **Integration tests:** use Testcontainers for Postgres & Kafka.
* **Contract tests:** Pact for producer/consumer contracts.
* **E2E tests:** run against an environment with all services (use `docker-compose` or ephemeral k8s environment).
* **Load tests:** Gatling / JMeter for throughput and latency analysis.

---

# Observability & Debugging

* **Tracing:** OpenTelemetry → Jaeger.
* **Metrics:** Micrometer → Prometheus → Grafana dashboards (transactions/s, latencies, errors).
* **Logging:** Structured JSON logs (Logback), centralize to ELK/EFK.
* Add **correlation ID** header across HTTP & Kafka messages (e.g., `X-Correlation-ID`).

---

# Security & Compliance

* Use TLS for all network traffic.
* OAuth2 / JWT with short-lived tokens.
* Input validation and strict schema validation for Kafka messages.
* Store PII encrypted at rest (Postgres column-level encryption for sensitive fields or use Vault).
* Rate limiting at API Gateway.
* Regular vulnerability scans for containers and dependencies.

---

# Performance Best Practices

* Use **HikariCP** connection pool and tune `maxPoolSize`.
* Cache frequently read but rarely changing data (exchange rates) in Redis with TTL.
* Denormalize read models for high-throughput read paths.
* Batch DB writes where possible; use async processing for non-blocking flows.
* Proper indexing on frequently queried columns (transaction id, status, timestamps).

---

# Coding Guidelines

* Use clear package separation, DTOs for api boundaries, immutability where possible.
* Keep controllers thin — delegate to services.
* Use `@Transactional` only at service boundaries.
* Avoid returning entities directly in APIs—use DTOs.
* Keep business rules in service layer; use validators for input rules.

---

# MVP Deliverables (Sprint 0 / Sprint 1)

**Sprint 0 (Week 1)**

* Repo & module skeleton
* Local infra scripts (Docker Compose) for Postgres, Kafka
* Transaction Service skeleton with DB migration and basic CRUD
* Basic CI pipeline

**Sprint 1 (Week 2-4)**

* Validation Service & KYC stubs
* Messaging events for transactions created/validated
* API Gateway & security integration (Keycloak)

---

# Next Steps — Immediate Actions for You

1. Choose repo strategy: mono‑repo (recommended for start) or multi‑repo.
2. Create parent Maven/Gradle project and `common` module.
3. Scaffold Transaction Service and run it locally with Postgres.
4. Implement DB migrations and simple `POST /transactions` endpoint.
5. Add Kafka and publish `transactions.created` events.

---

If you want, I can now:

* generate the **Maven multi-module skeleton** (pom + modules) for you,
* **scaffold the Transaction Service** (controller, service, repository, entity, DTO, Flyway migration), or
* produce a **docker-compose** file for local development (Postgres, Kafka, Redis, Keycloak) — which would help you run everything locally.

Tell me which of the three to create next and I will scaffold it immediately.
